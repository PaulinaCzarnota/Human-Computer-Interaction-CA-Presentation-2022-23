This is my team's CA 1 presentation for the Human Computer Interaction module in the second year of Computer Science at TU Dublin.

Our presentation aimed to gain empathy for individuals who struggle with completing tasks on existing digital products, specifically using the Daily Mail website as an example. We aimed to identify a problem and gather data through user research and desk research, develop personas and empathy maps, and create task descriptions. Additionally, the group reviewed other apps or products that have taken a better approach to the same design or challenge. The presentation covered all of these points and will be used to inform the design and evaluation of new, improved solutions in CA 2.
