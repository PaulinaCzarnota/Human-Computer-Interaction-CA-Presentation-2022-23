This is my CA 1 presentation for the Human Computer Interaction module in the second year of Computer Science at TU Dublin.

This is my team presentation which aims to gain empathy for individuals who struggle with completing tasks on existing digital products, specifically using the Daily Mail website as an example. Our goal is to identify a problem and gather data through user research and desk research, develop personas and empathy maps, and create task descriptions. Additionally, the group will review other apps or products that have taken a better approach to the same design or challenge. The presentation covers all of these points and will be used to inform the design and evaluation of new, improved solutions in Continuous Assessment 2.
